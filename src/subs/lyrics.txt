~ Verse 1 ~

Five years
that’s not too long
But it’s half a decade on
Since a lonely man
With a half-baked plan
started Ueno

With a keen eye
for classy design
he was working all alone
But the clients rolled in
So he hired a friend
And you wouldn’t believe how we’ve grown!

~ Refrain ~

Now we’re living the dream,
and building a team
Yeah, we’re on a golden road
With lots of new faces
And new office spaces
Creators of things a-la-mode.

~ Verse 2 ~

Yes we’re energized
By our KPIs
We’re clearly on a roll
There’s harmonizing and strategizing
Yes, Ueno is breaking the mold!

~ Refrain 2 ~

Now the Slacks and E-mails
And meeting alerts
Are greeted with a smile
Cause the Ueno way
Is NEVER to STOP!
[Coughs]
Me: Actually, can someone get me a drink?
OS: Water?
Me: No, like, a whiskey sour.
[Chugs drink halfway, pauses]
Me: Thanks.
[Resume chugging as trumpet solo starts.]

~ Instrumental Bridge Trumpet Solo ~

~ Refrain 3 ~

And now we’re working like hell!
At a feverish pace!
We love the agency life!
Cause we’re in it to Uen it!
A mile a minute!
We’ll do it until we die!

~ Verse 3 ~

Now that Ueno is five
We hope to survive
For at least thousand years.
Let me tell you for sure
It'll always endure
So dry your eyes
It’ll always abide
Yes, Ueno will always be arouuuuund!
