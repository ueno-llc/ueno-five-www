of your soul

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.570
straight from Humboldt County.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.410
It's my man Troy Satins.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.703
Five years

00:00:25.823 --> 00:00:27.294
thatâ€™s not too long

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.520
But itâ€™s half a decade on

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.850
Since a lonely man

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.375
With a half-baked plan

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.698
started Ueno

00:00:40.998 --> 00:00:43.259
a fri

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.180
end.

00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:52.150
And you wouldn't believe
how we've grown.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.750
Now we're having a dream
and building our.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.720
But a lot of.
These. Cities.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.000
Office space
is creators of things.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.870
Jazzed.
By.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.930
&gt;&gt;  This harmonizing and
strategizing use to breaking.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.470
Now this lacks any. Meaning.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.570
&gt;&gt; Oh great. This.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.870
WINDOW IS. NOW. TO. STOP.

Somebody gave me a drink.
Oh. Thank you.

Feverish pace.
We love the agency.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.810
Goes we're in it to win.
My. Food. To eat.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.830
&gt;&gt; Now that window is back.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.720
We hope to survive
for at least a thousand.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.490
Let me tell you for sure.
It'll always do. To try.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.320
&gt;&gt; Right.
It'll always apply you.
